A 3d printable modular housing for IoT devices

![Example](/pictures/example1.jpg)

## Motivation

I like to create ESP8266 based IoT devices. Owning a 3d printer, any such device project should be finished with a decent 3d printed housing for the device. But reality proves that such kind of finish often lies within the final 20% of a project that never get done.

I'd like to prepare a modular system that speeds up the design process of a housing for that purpose. I already started working on it and it feels like
* others might also be interested in such a solution and
* others might want to participate in creating it.

So, welcome to the place where you get both!

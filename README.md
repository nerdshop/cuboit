# Cuboit
A 3d printable modular housing for IoT devices

![Example](/pictures/example1.jpg)

## Motivation

I like to create ESP8266 based IoT devices. Owning a 3d printer, any such device project should be finished with a decent 3d printed housing for the device. But reality proves that such kind of finish often lies within the final 20% of a project that never get done.

I'd like to prepare a modular system that speeds up the design process of a housing for that purpose. I already started working on it and it feels like
* others might also be interested in such a solution and
* others might want to participate in creating it.

So, welcome to the place where you get both!

## Description

Cuboit is a collection of 3d printable parts that can be put together as a cuboid. You print some edges that connect six walls. These walls are either plain walls or walls that are able to mount certain IoT device modules.

This project tries to achieve the following features:

* Each part is printable without supports.
* No additional mounting material is required (screwless).
* Each wall variant is designed for one single purpose.
* There is only one edge length.

The idea of these requirements is to keep things simple, but they might change in the future.

## Roadmap

Hopefully there will be more walls supporting various devices soon.

The models are currently designed using Autodesk Fusion 360. But for better maintainability it might be useful to migrate to OpenSCAD.

Additional edge lengths should be supported in the future. Also more flexible wall designs allowing to mount multiple modules would be nice. But for now the system is limited to one device per wall and one edge length to keep things simple.
